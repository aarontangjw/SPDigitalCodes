# SPDigitalCodes
This project is the pre-interview test for Singapore Power iGrad programme. 

To run the program simply run KeyPadTest.java in any IDE or Command Line.

# My review

Program uses String to represent keypad sequences.
I used hashmap as the choice for data structure for quicker computation of sequence combinations.

Encountered time constraint in doing the question (within 4 hours). Only able to work on Question 1.

# How I would have done Question 2 

Continue the code from Question 1, add the position input parameter,
removing all but the letter combinations with the specific letter in that position.
